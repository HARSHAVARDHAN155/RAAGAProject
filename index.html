                    <p style="font-size: 16px;padding: 103px;"><strong><em><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">His Life:</span></em></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp; Due to his flute training, he took an additional 1.5 years to finish his house surgeon residency as a merit student completing his MBBS. He started learning at the age of 13 and it's already been 31 years in the journey of music. He was inspired to pursue the hobby by his uncle Dattatreya, a Doordarshan artist who gave him his first flute. Ramachandra Murthy learned Carnatic music from his mother and Hindustani from his uncle. His family wanted to see him as a doctor, but he chose to become a flutist. At that point of time, he received a lot of support for entering this field is very rare. And luckily, he received a lot of support from his partner. He always preferred getting the flutes from Mumbai, Delhi, and Sirsi districts in Karnataka. He prefers to teach music to pupils while he isn’t performing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br></p>
                    <h1 style="font-family: 'Kaushan Script', serif;text-align: left;margin: 25px;"><span style="color: rgb(32, 33, 34); background-color: transparent;">Flute</span></h1>
                    <p style="padding: 8px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the most distinctive musical instruments is the flute. It's not only the oldest instrument; every civilization in the world uses it, making it the sole musical instrument. &nbsp; The simple flute had several functions, including communication between and within tribes, with livestock, and most notably, as a kind of musical entertainment. The majority of flutes are primarily made of a tube with a mouthpiece on one end. The mouthpiece's oval-shaped hole is blown across by the performer while holding the flute horizontally. The performer simultaneously depresses the flute's keys, which are levers or holes</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Indian Flute was separately evolved from its western counterpart and is often constructed of bamboo. The seventh hole on the Indian Classical flute is additional compared to its folk counterpart to allow the full spectrum of traditional ragas. Further techniques were developed by Pandit Raghunath Prasanna to enable the flute to properly replicate the intricacies and complexities of Indian Classical music. In addition to the Indian Classical Flute, the bansuri is a common instrument in North Indian Hindustani music. It has six finger holes and one embouchure hole. Cross-fingering is a technique used by South Indian Carnatic musicians when playing the eight-holed velu&nbsp;</span><br></p>
                    <h3 style="font-family: 'Kaushan Script', serif;text-align: left;margin: 21px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Interview:</span></strong></h3>
                    <p style="padding: 25px;margin: 6px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The conversation with Ramachandra Murthy started with how the recordings and songs are formed by the combination of tracks of various instrument music. He has his studio in his house itself. For the songs, he needs to add the flute track, record it, and then combine all the tracks like the one with the song, and other instruments.&nbsp;&nbsp; He played the Pahadi Raaga using the flute.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Arohi: P - 'D - S - R - G - P - D – S&nbsp;Avarohi: S' - N - D - P - m - G - R - s - 'n - 'd - 'P - 'd – S.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The music he played has reminded us of the village atmosphere. This Raaga is very popular in movies. This Raaga is used for introducing the village culture and sometimes for introducing the characters from the villages. As such, he argued that the music or raga of the folk, classical, and Hindustani, among others, cannot be distinguished from the raga of the folk or raga of the classical, among others. He said that “just like how religions don’t have any distinction between the people even the raga and traditions”. Most of his learnings were Carnatic, Hindustani, and western types of raga(music) to get the broader spectra of raaga.</span><br></p>
                    <p style="margin: 3px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What is the difference that can be analyzed between the various forms like Western, Hindustani, and Carnatic while playing flute?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Carnatic is a little deeper and it's very tough to perform because of gamakalu(ornamentation), as it needs different types of flutes to play them. For Light music and movie songs, we need Hindustani and Western music.&nbsp;&nbsp;Carnatic Music has many gamakalu. They make Carnatic more beautiful but very tough to sing. But coming to the Hindustani, there will be less number of gamakalu which makes it easy to play. Example: Aaj Jane ki Jid Na Karo is part of Hindustani and it is easy to play.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very advantageous to be well-versed in everything. It is good to have knowledge about western music even if you are not in the field. Western improvisation to Carnatic is refreshing to the audience.&nbsp;One beauty of Carnatic music is that nothing is on paper, everything is abstract. In Carnatic music there is the freedom to choose and improvise. In western music everything is on paper, every minute detail is finely defined.&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">How many types of flutes are there and how will they differ?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For each scale, there will be different flutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;For more Bass(amplitude of vibration), we increase the size of the length of the flute. For more pitch, we increase frequency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">How will tune your flute to use different scales in the same composition?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Mostly the same flute is used throughout the composition. It mostly depends on the range of the flute.Sa-re-ga-ma-pa-da-ni is in only two actives. So by manipulating the fingering of the flute, we can adjust the lower notes and higher notes.We can change the scale using this.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Will we use different flutes for the same composition?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We actually use the same flute for one single composition.&nbsp;&nbsp;They make use of one type of flute, that may belong to any type of scale. If we want to make use of different scale notes, then we use the same given scale to get the notes of for the new scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three ways in which we can convert from one note to another. They are Arpeggios, broken chords and scales in thirds.&nbsp;Arpeggio is an Italian word that means "harp playing." We 'pluck' selected notes from a scale that make up a chord - often the first, third, and fifth notes (and eighth note or octave).&nbsp;Broken chords Take it a step further and repeat the arpeggio notes beginning on each step of the arpeggio.&nbsp;In thirds scales, an interval known as a 'third' is introduced between each note of the scale.&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(62, 63, 58); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">How many different types of flutes do you have?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A standard kit contains 37 flutes. They symbolize three octaves. Each octave consists of 12 notes. C is repeated and hence 37 notes.All the flutes are based on the keys of the keyboard. (G, G-sharp, D, etc)In the Bass flute, even each half note is considered a note. Like g1, g2 , m1, m2 etc.There are many types of western flutes also like the key flute&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(62, 63, 58); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">How do various parameters affect the Notes in the flute?&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">For A has 440 Hz. For recording, they make use of frequencies ranging between 440 and 450Hz. Based on A only, others will be tuned.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the one which is played is not that is same as 440Hz, then we make adjustments by +5 or –5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">What about his medical field?&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He was done with MBBS. But not done with PG.&nbsp;While he was about to start PG, he got offers in playing flute for films.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also into the teaching field. He teaches Western, Hindustani, and Carnatic fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Group performance/ Solo Performance?&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He always prefers JugalBandi.&nbsp;A jugalbandi or jugalbandhi is a performance in Indian classical music that comprises a duet of two solo players, most commonly in Hindustani classical music but also in Carnatic. The term jugalbandi literally means "entwined twins." The duet might be vocal or instrumental in nature.&nbsp;Any two instruments will take the lead and in background, other instruments like the violin, etc will accompany them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Did you ever experiment with Raaga?&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He showed us the changes he made on the blue scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;The blues scale is the pentatonic scale plus one note. This note became known as the "blue note," and it is the flat fifth in the minor pentatonic scale or the flat third in the major pentatonic scale.&nbsp;He conveyed that using such blue scales in the middle of the deep-going concert will attract the listeners.&nbsp;It gives a western touch. When played in concerts, it gives a refreshing touch to the audience and grabs their attention.</span><br><br></p><em style="font-size: 16px;text-align: left;border-style: none;border-color: rgb(12,13,13);color: var(--bs-blue);font-weight: bold;background: #fbdb34;padding: 2px;margin: 46px;"><span style="font-style: normal !important; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The hexatonic (six-note) blues scale is basically a </span><a href="http://www.flutetunes.com/scales/minor-pentatonic-scales.php"><span style="font-style: normal !important; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">minor pentatonic scale</span></a><span style="font-style: normal !important; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> with the addition of a blue note between the fourth and the fifth degrees. That single note creates a typical Blues sound.Many times it's just the best choice for solo improvisation, and, as long as you play the right notes, there's really no wrong way to do it.</span><br></em>
                    <p><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">How much time do you devote to music in a day?&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The practice of flute also helps in Pranayam, it not only helps in improving the breathing capacity but also helps in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.&nbsp;On average, more than 10 hours are spent on music every day.&nbsp;The daily routine is very interlinked with music, be it music practice or concerts or teaching, or other performances, music is a continuous part of everyday life.Even the concerts are conducted on a very regular basis.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Do you prefer slow-based compositions or fast compositions?&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Start with slow and gradually increase the tempo and raise the climax and end it it high. Vilambit is an introductory slow tempo, or laya, between 25 and 75 beats per minute, used in the performance of a raga in Hindustani classical music. For major ragas, the vilambit portion generally takes up two-thirds or more of the performance.The composition starts in Vilambith, then enters madhyalay and then drut and finally ends in Ati drut.</span>&nbsp;<br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Vilambit is an introductory slow tempo, or lia, between 25 and 75 beats per minute.

Do you rehearse with them or is it on the spot?&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The most challenging yet the best part is that we have to be able to catch up with others by just knowing the scale of the Raaga. It is enough to know if it is a major scale or a minor scale.&nbsp;Music is universal so if we know the terms (E major, E-diminished, etc), it is helpful to connect and easily sync with other instrumentalists and vocalists.A basic understanding is enough to connect with people from other styles.</span><br><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">How confident are you in general while playing on the stage?&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is not easy to perform on stage with mediocre levels of practice. Every moment on the stage there’s this tension of not being able to perform your best.There is more freedom in classical music. It is enough to practice at home&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“I believe in ‘practice like a devil and perform like an angel’ and follow the 10,000-hour rule for this.”</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It is frightening to play a wrong note in front of an audience.&nbsp;We need to practice every day in order to not lose our grip on music.</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">How has technological advancement effect your profession?&nbsp;</span></strong><br>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(241, 194, 50); background-color: transparent;">Previously:</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Earlier, many people had to get together in order to practice as every instrument is accompanied by other instruments.This created a nice bonding session and helped everyone improve by giving each other critiques about the way they played or sang a particular Raaga.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(241, 194, 50); background-color: transparent;">Present:</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Online Software has replaced the Tabla or Mridungam players who initially had to be present for most of the practice sessions. The practice sessions would be scheduled according to everyone’s availability.&nbsp;But at the same time technology is being taken for granted. It is fine for the practice level but sitting and practicing with a person is different as you will get inputs.</span><br><br><strong>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Do you like modifications introduced in the music in the new generation? Do you follow the trend?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The concert should be played like a concert. We should not deviate from the rules of Raaga. Might be in music songs, you need not stick to the scale but too much deviation is not very appreciable.</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">How important is the profession from an academic point of view?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Theory and Practice go hand in hand. There should be a balance between knowledge and practical aspect. Improvisations should be done on the spot. Even the ability to do improvisation needs a lot of practice.</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Opinion on ‘Is the music field stable’?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every art form needs patience and dedication. Nothing is stable. You need to practice and practice and never give up. There should be healthy competition.&nbsp;One source of income is not always the best option.</span><br><br><img src="assets/img/chart_flute.png" style="margin: 9px;"><br></p>
                    <p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The above map represents the mapping between classical carnatic system and flute .The bansuri employ a relative scale that is comparable to the "do, re, mi" idea. The notes are not measured in proportion to the first note but rather in pitch (Hz).&nbsp; Furthermore, finger position, not tone, is used as the basis for the notation system.</span></p>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;padding: 19px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Srinivas Mantha is a well known Carnatic singer, he has an experience of over two decades. He has been teaching music and inspiring the youth with his voice for over 15 years. His voice is an innate gift. He was first introduced to the world of music at the age of 19. He hails from a family with no connection whatsoever to music, but with the support of his mother and with the blessings and guidance of his guru Hari Priya he has excelled in his field.&nbsp;He is not just a vocalist by soul but also a IT employee by profession. He is actively involved in social welfare and charity. He has a golden heart with a breathtaking voice. He owes all his success to his guru Hari Priya garu, who was one of the Hyderabad sisters and is one the legend in his field. He considers her his role model in the field.&nbsp;His family has been his constant support, they have encouraged him throughout his life with all his decisions. He studied MEC and then chose to pursue the IT sector while still balancing and dedicating ample amounts of time to his musical journey. He has given over 2000 performances and provided vocals in countless movies.&nbsp;He is a very humble and down to earth person. He has been in this field for the past 23 years</span><br></p>
                    <p style="padding: 8px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since the beginning of time, India has mastered the art of classical singing. Indian classical music is mentioned multiple times in the earliest Hindu scriptures. In India, classical music is not seen as a means of amusement but rather as a way to communicate with holy beings and recognise their existence inside ourselves. Therefore, listening to classical music is more like using a tool for doing so. The distinctive tunes, commonly referred to as "ragas," are supposed to trigger the "chakras," which are the energy centres or emotions in our bodies.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The core pitch (Sa) that each vocalist choose allows their voice to span three octaves because there is no fixed pitch structure in South Indian music. Typically, they stick to this sales spiel their whole lives. The selected pitch is played during a performance as a drone on a tambura (a plucked string instrument), or in more recent times, on a sruti box (a bellows-blown reed instrument, now often electronic). Traditionally, all learning is done by ear and memory as repertoire and style are passed down from guru to pupil. Before reaching a professional level, instruction may entail regular classes and practise over an extended period of ten to twenty years. Even though, a vocalist often studies for their whole lifespan.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Interview:We conducted an online interview with Mantha Srinivas where he shared his journey of Raaga.

                    <p style="margin: 3px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We conducted an online interview with Mantha Srinivas where he shared his journey of Raaga. We asked him questions regarding his perspective of Raaga and his opinion on various aspects of music.&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. How is your musical&nbsp; journey so far? How did it start?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It’s been about 23 years now, that was the time I started my graduation and I did not know any sa-pa-sa till then. I don’t hail from a music family at all, It’s the support of my parents that has gotten me where I am nowMany people in the field of music are introduced to music at a very young age, and 19 is an age at which you are expected to focus on a stable career.&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Did you face any challenges when you decided to pursue music as a career?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He considers his musical journey to be a miracle. It was his father who first suggested that he should try taking admission in the music college. He enrolled into the government music college along with his mother. He initially did not take music so seriously. They were taught the basics of Raaga initially, which he learnt effortlessly and hence did not find it very interesting as it was not challenging enough. According to him the turning point was when he was given the chance to sit in a senior class where they were practicing a Keerthana and he was mesmerized by it, that is when he realized the depth of carnatic music and how much he has in store to learn. He then developed a strong will to practice music everyday and made it his goal. He never expected to grow so much in this field, no one could believe that he never actually learnt music before that. He is a natural talent and music prodigy.</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Being a Carnatic musician, what is your opinion on western music?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Any music is divine, does not matter Carnatic, hindustani, western etc. We only have 12 different types of sounds universally. The way people in olden days were able to divide and differentiate between these sounds from decibels was true art. Music is always great and divine. If the sahityam (lyrics) is nice, any music will sound good. Music is always pleasant to the mind.</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Do you prefer solo performances or group performances?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both solo performances are equally beautiful but solo performances are challenging because everybody will direct all their attention towards the performer and there is no scope for flaws in it. It is easier to hide the flaws in group performances. The most important thing in any performance is to sing in shruti and lia. Any performance should not just give voice to the lyrics but should come out of the soul and touch another soul.&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What instrument do you prefer to accompany your performances?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though all the instruments are soothing, different instruments go well with different Raagas. Different instruments set different moods for the music, the combination of these instruments give a different flavor which can be easily understood even by a common man. Recently we have been adapting many western instruments in Carnatic music which give a new insight to it.</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Which Raaga do you prefer the most in your performance? Do you have a favorite Raaga?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every Raagam has got a different feel associated with it. Example: Shivaranjani Raagam sets a sorrowful mood whereas Mohana Raagam sets a very happy mood.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“I learnt ‘Madhyamavati’ Raga at the very beginning and I love it ever since then. I would say that is my favorite Raagam. I keep doing things and I suddenly switch to this Raagam''</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Madhyamavati Raga:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Raga Madhyamavathi is a piece of Carnatic music It is a pentatonic scale known as an audava raga since it only contains six of the seven musical notes (swaras). It is a janya raga (derived scale). Madhumad Sarang is the Hindustani musical equivalent of Madhyamavati.</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 16, 16); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 224);">Arohanam: &nbsp; S R2 M1 P N2 SAvarohanam: &nbsp; S N2 P M1 R2 S</span></strong><br><br><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Shivaranjani Raga:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Raag that draws Strength from Sadness is Sivaranjani. This Raag has beautiful melodies. This Raag is comparable to Raag Bhoopali, however instead of Shuddha Gandhar like in Bhoopali, it features Komal Gandhar</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 16, 16); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 224);">Arohanam: &nbsp; S R2 G2 P D2 SAvarohanam: &nbsp; S D2 P G2 R2 S</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Mohana raga:</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the earliest ragas, Mohana ragam is the Janya raga of the 28th Melakarta (parent) raga Harikamboji&nbsp; It symbolizes the rasas Veera (courage), Bhakthi (devotion), Karuna (compassion), and Raudra (angry/fury) among the Navarasas (emotions).</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 16, 16); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 224);">Arohanam: &nbsp; S R2 G3 P D2 SAvarohanam: &nbsp; S D2 P G3 R2 S</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Are there any Memorable performances of yours?&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I participated in State level carnatic music which i was not very confident about&nbsp; and i sang todi and to my surprise after 6 hours i was awarded the first place and it happened that i was&nbsp; to take award form mangalampalli balakrishna who was my idol&nbsp; it was the most memorable moment of my career and in my opinion people learning music should also think about doing social service music changed my life from a naughty kid to a responsible teacher Arts improve a person by improving their confidence levels and it also&nbsp; imparts discipline to an individual</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. “Should arts be made mandatory” ?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yes it should be mandatory because people can explore the different subjects i hope that arts become mainstream subject and i also believe arts will help in reducing the family tensions arts helps in transformation of people as in my experience i had a terrible stage fear but after learning music i was able to speak in front of many people sometimes i feel if i should have started much earlier and i also feel musicians are discriminated</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. How many hours do you practice in a day?</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Due to time constraints i will practice whenever it is possible it will become difficult once you were shouldered with responsibility recalling one memory&nbsp; Once due to singing i missed the bus stop and i also recommend people to learn early in their career and afterwards people will have duties</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What Response do you want&nbsp; to give to&nbsp; people who are saying that&nbsp; music field is not stable?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;People are not able to practice music freely because of the monetary conditions and unpredictability of the domain and government should help regarding this situation and sometimes it tis true that music could be challenging&nbsp; but we have also seen cases where musicians are earning really great&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Being a vocalist requires a great skill set on breathing techniques how do you practice regarding breathing techniques?&nbsp;Every morning after i woke up i will&nbsp; do pranayama and other breathing exercises to improve my technique regarding breathing it is important to have good respiratory health for honing our breathing skills it also helps us in voice</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Do you prefer experiments on raga?</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Within the bounds of improving the performance of the raga we can experiment with the nodes and tune of the original raga in the end we have to please audience but some ragas are better left alone and also&nbsp; i am free flow artist and hence i sing on the flow&nbsp; based on my imagination</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What do you prefer: slow or fast composition?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Generally&nbsp; It depends on the mood and i prefer both for example Janani is a slow composition but is graceful and expressive and another example is tilanna which is fast and more energetic and it also depends on emotion of the performance&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Any Idol or inspiration?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Haripriya my teacher is my idol and inspiration in my career i have learnt everything from her and&nbsp; my mother also motivated me&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; music&nbsp; and my favorite composers are&nbsp; annamacharya because he composed all emotions regarding god and also ramadasu because he made music simple and elegant</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What do you say about vocal support for Dance ?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I also give vocal support with dance and it is different when compared to giving a solo performance and it is also challenging to do as it involves multiple coordination between me and the dancer&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What message do you want to send to the youth?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Pursue any art you like and take it seriously because arts&nbsp; improves the person both emotionally and mentally it can also help in reducing the stress levels of a person and i would like to encourage youth to take arts seriously whether they are interested in pursuing their career in arts or not&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Analysis of interview :</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In this interview we tried to understand a professional vocalist’s understanding of&nbsp; carnatic ragas and tunes .Dr Mantha Srinivas provided an in-depth view on vocalists' role in performance . we also tried to understand how the synchrony happens between the tune and the voice we also wanted to understand a vocalists perspective on western music and how modular changes are done in order to incorporate such tones&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Next we learnt about the importance of emotion in music and it’s impact on performance then he also compared both fast and slow compositions by performing an example of each version and next we also learnt about the impact of art on musician we also understood that the voice is coached in a way that a singer would be able to produce a particular song with ease and perfection. Such an acquirement hones the individual’s abilities with sustaining music notes, desired speed of rendering and ability to switch between speeds effortlessly and rendering the musical expression</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We understood the role of lungs and vocal cards&nbsp; in voice training. The vocal cords facilitate sound generation and control airflow into the lungs. It was also important to consider their protection of the airway from choking on throat debris and we learnt about pranayama techniques inorder to have maintain good breathing technique which is important for a vocalist and afterwards we tried to understand what it takes to become a top notch vocalist the ins and outs in the end he explained the importance of arts</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Relation with our course:</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The highly structured, centuries-old melodic framework of Carnatic music is rich and varied. The 22 srutis that can be recognised by the human ear were developed by ancient musicologists&nbsp; They also created a number of note patterns that help to expand the human vocal system's flexibility, range, and quality of sound. Finding and fixing the sruti or adhara shadjamam for a certain learner is the first stage in Voice Training</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The system includes everything from simple practise material to the most complex masterpieces from a variety of composers.In a more organised manner Purandara Dasa wrote out the specifics of the educational system.There are essentially two main branches:</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1. Abhyasa&nbsp; ganam (Precomposed music): Practicing verses and musical compositions by&nbsp; vaggeyakaras like Ramadasa, Annamayya etc Abhyasa gana is a precomposed music. It includes the initial simple practice verses to complex&nbsp; varnams and&nbsp; kritis. The initial practice exercises emphasize on singing the basic sapta swaras at right frequency level in reference to the fundamental note</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2.Manodharma Sangeetham (Improvised Music): During a live performance, improvisation takes place dynamically in the form of Raga alapana (exploring the nuances of the raga), Neraval (lyrical exploration), Swara kalpana (permutations and combinations of swara patterns adhering to the raga along with the tala and emotion of the song), and Pallavi of composition</span><br><br></p>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;padding: 19px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Kolanka Sai Kumar</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"> is a very popular violinist both on the music and dance circuit. Born to well known Mridangam player Shri Kolanka Laxman Rao, Saikumar trained under the well known Shri Peri Sree Rama Murthy.He has been an important part of the Shankarananda Kalakshetra ensemble adding the beauty of his violin playing to the dance, impressing the audience with his creativity and control over the instrument. He tours regularly with Shankarananda Kalakshetra, even as he continues to perform as a soloist and as a duo with his brother Anil Kumar on the Carnatic Music circuit.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Violin is a wooden instrument played entirely with strings. The body of most violins is made of hollow wood. It is the smallest and most often used instrument in the family (soprano)&nbsp; Typically, the violin has four strings (some can have five) Additionally, it may be played by pinching the strings with the fingers (pizzicato), and in some circumstances, the wooden side of the bow can be used to strike the strings.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Since the violin's invention in the early 16th century, there has been a long history of experimentation. First, the makers of the violin themselves empirically improved it over more than 200 years to reach its pinnacle of excellence in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Then, since the early 19th century, scientists have studied the violin's vibrational properties.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Aside from having a distinctive tone that distinguishes it from other instruments, the violin is one of the most significant instruments in Western classical music due to its exceptional musical agility, which allows it to play intricate note sequences in quick succession.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Picking the proper strings for a violin is crucial. Low-quality strings will produce cacophonous noises when a violinist attempts to stroke the strings,On a violin, each string produces a different tone. Because metal has the maximum tension and can produce the highest frequency sound, the E string, which is the highest note, is typically constructed of metal. While the G string, the lowest note, is composed of gut core string, which has far less tension than metal and produces low frequencies, the G string is constructed of metal.</span><br></p>

The proportions of the bass bar, bridge, fingerboard, neck, and tailpiece are different from those of modern violins. They are frequently played without a chin rest or shoulder rest. The baroque instrument's narrower neck angle reduces stress on the bridge and strings. There is also a shorter fingerboard.Despite these differences, a violin from the baroque and modern periods appear identical. Where they truly differ is in their sound. A baroque violin typically has a softer tone and is tuned lower.</span><br></p>

Numerous master violinists have been refining the necessary methods since the 19th century.&nbsp;In contrast to western music, the violin is tuned differently in carnatic music. Similar to this, there are other ways to hold the violin. Contrary to Western music, Indian classical music does not prohibit the use of the left and right hands in transposition. There are variations in bow-holding techniques and other elements among different pedagogical institutions; nonetheless, it would be difficult to identify and select the optimal way. Based on the western manner of playing the violin&nbsp; there has been a harmonization made in terms of holding the instrument and the participation of the right and left hand.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">A carnatic song is composed using the notes "Sa" (Shadja) and "Pa." (Panchamam). The "Adhara Shadja Mam" is chosen by a vocalist or an instrumentalist based on their respective instruments.According to swara Sa, all swaras connected to one octave are in harmony (Shadja). The samvadi swara of "Sa" is panchama swara (Pa). The violin consists of four strings. The first string, which we refer to as "G," is tuned as "Mandra Sthai "Sa," followed by "D," "A," "Madhyamasthay "Sa," and "E," which is tuned as "Madhyamasthay "Pa." The four strings on top are tuned appropriately.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Violin students must tune their instruments to "Sa" "Pa" "Sa" "Pa" or "D" "A" "D" "A'' using a pitch pipe, electronic shruti box, electronic keyboard, piano picking the pitch, or adhara shadja man. For violin solo performances in Carnatic music, Adharashadjamam is typically played in the keys of D, E, or F.</span><br><br></p>

                    <p style="margin: 3px;"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. How did you join this field?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">My grandfather is a mridangam artist and my father also learnt mrudangam from him so basically my father side is into music this is how i am interested into this field and i was encouraged to learn music from my childhood days</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Did you try other instruments?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yes i have tried other instruments other than violin but my father wanted us not to learn mridangam because it was a hard and heavy instrument so we never were inclined&nbsp; to learn other instruments&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. When did you decide that violin is your career?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">when i was young i never thought about it as my profession and it was all about fun and slowly after i got recognition i started to consider violin as my career and it happened roughly around 18 to 20 years of my age</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Do you prefer solo or group performance?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Solo is much difficult to perform and from my childhood me and my brother performed together and it was synchronous and hence melodious but when performed solo every tune have to be perfectly in sync when performed in group there can be small window for error and i would always like to perform with my brother</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Any memorable concert of yours ?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">There are many performances that are memorable to me and at the end of the day we all should try to make audience happy and i also had the honor to play with bala murali garu once and i also played the violin&nbsp; with nuka chinna satyam garu and those are certainly some of the great memories i have&nbsp; and many abroad trips are performed with indian flavor of violin added and the most memorable moment was playing at rashtrapati bhavan in front of abdul kalam</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What do you prefer Western music or indian music?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I am always excited about any kind of music and if we observe the origin of violin it is clear than it was an western instrument if we learn classical music then we can also&nbsp; play western music because most of the instrumental structure is similar in both of them and classical music has more depth i like both of them but if give only one i would prefer classical&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Difference in classical and western music in perspective of violin ?There are similarities and differences concerning both classical and western music There is difference in handling the notes we have a lot of gamakas but the western music doesn't have&nbsp; them&nbsp; and also western music have different scales&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Gamaka, which can also be written gamakas, refers to ornamentation utilized in both North and South Indian classical music performances. Gamaka is an embellishment that is placed on a note or in between two notes. There are at least fifteen main types of ornamentation used in contemporary Carnatic music. Gamaka, which emphasizes the distinctiveness of each raga, is any delicate turn, curve, or cornering touch applied to a single note or group of notes.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q.Your Favorite raga?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Keeravani raga is my favorite&nbsp; and i also like todi raga since&nbsp; violin is a very difficult instrument to handle we have to have pinpoint accuracy in placing the tourette and bow and also violinist&nbsp; have to be prepared for all the ragas because we never know what the vocalist will sing it has to be spontaneous and it will be always a challenge unlike the western musicians who does concerts in group classical music has to be performed with strict rules and hence lot of practise in required&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Which is more important, lyrics or raga?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In the end we have to connect with audience that is the prime motivation for us and&nbsp; when we come to lyrical part a violinist have no role in it because of the way violin is designed so as an violinist we try to focus more or raga and tune so raga is more important for a violinst&nbsp; and we also try to manage parallely and the most important thing for a violinist is to try to manage the flow of the song and perform melodiously&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Do you prefer Experiments on violin ?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yes i love to experiment with violin and i also play different kinds of violin example 5 string violin 4 string violin and electric violin for connecting with audience sometimes we perform the classical song and then variation of classical song&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. How often do you Practice ?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Practise is eternal and i feel guilty if i don't practice even once in a day and due to age constraints after some stage in life we all will have responsibilities and it becomes difficult to practice and hone your schools</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Do you prefer Slow or fast composition?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It all&nbsp; depends on the vocalist and in classical music both are preferred it also depends on time of the performance of the song&nbsp; for example in kacheri/sabha lyrics are preferred hence we have to go slow and sometimes even i would prefer slow composition because it would be easy to interpret and in general&nbsp; i would prefer bigger and longer keertanas&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Any idol or inspiration?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">My favorite composer is tyagaraja because he made the music simple and elegant&nbsp; and regarding my inspiration i have always admired&nbsp; ms gopalakrishnan&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Do you have any&nbsp; Message for&nbsp; youth?</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Explore the art form and try to enjoy the process but&nbsp; put efficient time and effort in learning the art thoroughly</span><br><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Analysis of the interview :</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We tried to understand the journey of dr sai and how he became professional in violin what he learnt and how many hours did he practice and how many variations of art forms he can performFrom the interview we understood that becoming an violinist is not an easy task it requires consistent efforts from person who is learning it dr sai also explained the ins and outs of playing violin and how the emotions and lyrics are expressed throughout the entire performance</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Being a violinist he said that the hardest part of the process is synchronization of the melody of the song with the vocalists voice where we have to understand the lyrics of the song the tempo of the vocalist current singing and the notes the singer is currently singing and try to decode them he also explained the difference between western violin music and indian carnatic music incorporated with violin in indian music we use more gamakas and tunes while in western music the scales are different&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Next he showed us variations of raga with violin we were able to differentiate different ragas based on emotion and tune he played todi raga he played a kalyani raga and its variation next we had the opportunity&nbsp; to understand pace of the violin whether he preferred the fast compositions or slow ones although each&nbsp; one had their own pros and cons he told that he would prefer slow ones as they have complete depth in lyrics and then we asked his most memorable moments his inspiration to become violinist&nbsp; and then we concluded the interview by asking his opinion on current situation of arts and advice to learn violin</span><br><br><br><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Connection to our raga course&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;Since the frequency structure remains intact the notes that are present in current classical music system can be mapped to notes on violin as&nbsp;</span><br><img src="assets/img/voilen2.png"><br><br><img src="assets/img/voil1.png"><br><br></p>

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;padding: 19px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Srinivas Mantha is a well known Carnatic singer, he has an experience of over two decades. He has been teaching music and inspiring the youth with his voice for over 15 years. His voice is an innate gift. He was first introduced to the world of music at the age of 19. He hails from a family with no connection whatsoever to music, but with the support of his mother and with the blessings and guidance of his guru Hari Priya he has excelled in his field.&nbsp;He is not just a vocalist by soul but also a IT employee by profession. He is actively involved in social welfare and charity. He has a golden heart with a breathtaking voice. He owes all his success to his guru Hari Priya garu, who was one of the Hyderabad sisters and is one the legend in his field. He considers her his role model in the field.&nbsp;His family has been his constant support, they have encouraged him throughout his life with all his decisions. He studied MEC and then chose to pursue the IT sector while still balancing and dedicating ample amounts of time to his musical journey. He has given over 2000 performances and provided vocals in countless movies.&nbsp;He is a very humble and down to earth person. He has been in this field for the past 23 years</span><br></p>
                    <p style="padding: 8px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Since the beginning of time, India has mastered the art of classical singing. Indian classical music is mentioned multiple times in the earliest Hindu scriptures. In India, classical music is not seen as a means of amusement but rather as a way to communicate with holy beings and recognise their existence inside ourselves. Therefore, listening to classical music is more like using a tool for doing so. The distinctive tunes, commonly referred to as "ragas," are supposed to trigger the "chakras," which are the energy centres or emotions in our bodies.</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The core pitch (Sa) that each vocalist choose allows their voice to span three octaves because there is no fixed pitch structure in South Indian music. Typically, they stick to this sales spiel their whole lives. The selected pitch is played during a performance as a drone on a tambura (a plucked string instrument), or in more recent times, on a sruti box (a bellows-blown reed instrument, now often electronic). Traditionally, all learning is done by ear and memory as repertoire and style are passed down from guru to pupil. Before reaching a professional level, instruction may entail regular classes and practise over an extended period of ten to twenty years. Even though, a vocalist often studies for their whole lifespan.</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Interview:We conducted an online interview with Mantha Srinivas where he shared his journey of Raaga.

                    <p style="margin: 3px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We conducted an online interview with Mantha Srinivas where he shared his journey of Raaga. We asked him questions regarding his perspective of Raaga and his opinion on various aspects of music.&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. How is your musical&nbsp; journey so far? How did it start?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">It’s been about 23 years now, that was the time I started my graduation and I did not know any sa-pa-sa till then. I don’t hail from a music family at all, It’s the support of my parents that has gotten me where I am nowMany people in the field of music are introduced to music at a very young age, and 19 is an age at which you are expected to focus on a stable career.&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Did you face any challenges when you decided to pursue music as a career?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">He considers his musical journey to be a miracle. It was his father who first suggested that he should try taking admission in the music college. He enrolled into the government music college along with his mother. He initially did not take music so seriously. They were taught the basics of Raaga initially, which he learnt effortlessly and hence did not find it very interesting as it was not challenging enough. According to him the turning point was when he was given the chance to sit in a senior class where they were practicing a Keerthana and he was mesmerized by it, that is when he realized the depth of carnatic music and how much he has in store to learn. He then developed a strong will to practice music everyday and made it his goal. He never expected to grow so much in this field, no one could believe that he never actually learnt music before that. He is a natural talent and music prodigy.</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Being a Carnatic musician, what is your opinion on western music?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Any music is divine, does not matter Carnatic, hindustani, western etc. We only have 12 different types of sounds universally. The way people in olden days were able to divide and differentiate between these sounds from decibels was true art. Music is always great and divine. If the sahityam (lyrics) is nice, any music will sound good. Music is always pleasant to the mind.</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Do you prefer solo performances or group performances?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Both solo performances are equally beautiful but solo performances are challenging because everybody will direct all their attention towards the performer and there is no scope for flaws in it. It is easier to hide the flaws in group performances. The most important thing in any performance is to sing in shruti and lia. Any performance should not just give voice to the lyrics but should come out of the soul and touch another soul.&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What instrument do you prefer to accompany your performances?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Though all the instruments are soothing, different instruments go well with different Raagas. Different instruments set different moods for the music, the combination of these instruments give a different flavor which can be easily understood even by a common man. Recently we have been adapting many western instruments in Carnatic music which give a new insight to it.</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Which Raaga do you prefer the most in your performance? Do you have a favorite Raaga?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Every Raagam has got a different feel associated with it. Example: Shivaranjani Raagam sets a sorrowful mood whereas Mohana Raagam sets a very happy mood.&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">“I learnt ‘Madhyamavati’ Raga at the very beginning and I love it ever since then. I would say that is my favorite Raagam. I keep doing things and I suddenly switch to this Raagam''</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Madhyamavati Raga:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Raga Madhyamavathi is a piece of Carnatic music It is a pentatonic scale known as an audava raga since it only contains six of the seven musical notes (swaras). It is a janya raga (derived scale). Madhumad Sarang is the Hindustani musical equivalent of Madhyamavati.</span><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 16, 16); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 224);">Arohanam: &nbsp; S R2 M1 P N2 SAvarohanam: &nbsp; S N2 P M1 R2 S</span></strong><br><br><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Shivaranjani Raga:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The Raag that draws Strength from Sadness is Sivaranjani. This Raag has beautiful melodies. This Raag is comparable to Raag Bhoopali, however instead of Shuddha Gandhar like in Bhoopali, it features Komal Gandhar</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 16, 16); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 224);">Arohanam: &nbsp; S R2 G2 P D2 SAvarohanam: &nbsp; S D2 P G2 R2 S</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Mohana raga:</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">One of the earliest ragas, Mohana ragam is the Janya raga of the 28th Melakarta (parent) raga Harikamboji&nbsp; It symbolizes the rasas Veera (courage), Bhakthi (devotion), Karuna (compassion), and Raudra (angry/fury) among the Navarasas (emotions).</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(128, 16, 16); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 224);">Arohanam: &nbsp; S R2 G3 P D2 SAvarohanam: &nbsp; S D2 P G3 R2 S</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Are there any Memorable performances of yours?&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I participated in State level carnatic music which i was not very confident about&nbsp; and i sang todi and to my surprise after 6 hours i was awarded the first place and it happened that i was&nbsp; to take award form mangalampalli balakrishna who was my idol&nbsp; it was the most memorable moment of my career and in my opinion people learning music should also think about doing social service music changed my life from a naughty kid to a responsible teacher Arts improve a person by improving their confidence levels and it also&nbsp; imparts discipline to an individual</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. “Should arts be made mandatory” ?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Yes it should be mandatory because people can explore the different subjects i hope that arts become mainstream subject and i also believe arts will help in reducing the family tensions arts helps in transformation of people as in my experience i had a terrible stage fear but after learning music i was able to speak in front of many people sometimes i feel if i should have started much earlier and i also feel musicians are discriminated</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. How many hours do you practice in a day?</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Due to time constraints i will practice whenever it is possible it will become difficult once you were shouldered with responsibility recalling one memory&nbsp; Once due to singing i missed the bus stop and i also recommend people to learn early in their career and afterwards people will have duties</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What Response do you want&nbsp; to give to&nbsp; people who are saying that&nbsp; music field is not stable?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;People are not able to practice music freely because of the monetary conditions and unpredictability of the domain and government should help regarding this situation and sometimes it tis true that music could be challenging&nbsp; but we have also seen cases where musicians are earning really great&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Being a vocalist requires a great skill set on breathing techniques how do you practice regarding breathing techniques?&nbsp;Every morning after i woke up i will&nbsp; do pranayama and other breathing exercises to improve my technique regarding breathing it is important to have good respiratory health for honing our breathing skills it also helps us in voice</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Do you prefer experiments on raga?</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Within the bounds of improving the performance of the raga we can experiment with the nodes and tune of the original raga in the end we have to please audience but some ragas are better left alone and also&nbsp; i am free flow artist and hence i sing on the flow&nbsp; based on my imagination</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What do you prefer: slow or fast composition?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Generally&nbsp; It depends on the mood and i prefer both for example Janani is a slow composition but is graceful and expressive and another example is tilanna which is fast and more energetic and it also depends on emotion of the performance&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. Any Idol or inspiration?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Haripriya my teacher is my idol and inspiration in my career i have learnt everything from her and&nbsp; my mother also motivated me&nbsp; regarding&nbsp; music&nbsp; and my favorite composers are&nbsp; annamacharya because he composed all emotions regarding god and also ramadasu because he made music simple and elegant</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What do you say about vocal support for Dance ?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I also give vocal support with dance and it is different when compared to giving a solo performance and it is also challenging to do as it involves multiple coordination between me and the dancer&nbsp;</span><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Q. What message do you want to send to the youth?</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Pursue any art you like and take it seriously because arts&nbsp; improves the person both emotionally and mentally it can also help in reducing the stress levels of a person and i would like to encourage youth to take arts seriously whether they are interested in pursuing their career in arts or not&nbsp;</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Analysis of interview :</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">In this interview we tried to understand a professional vocalist’s understanding of&nbsp; carnatic ragas and tunes .Dr Mantha Srinivas provided an in-depth view on vocalists' role in performance . we also tried to understand how the synchrony happens between the tune and the voice we also wanted to understand a vocalists perspective on western music and how modular changes are done in order to incorporate such tones&nbsp;</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Next we learnt about the importance of emotion in music and it’s impact on performance then he also compared both fast and slow compositions by performing an example of each version and next we also learnt about the impact of art on musician we also understood that the voice is coached in a way that a singer would be able to produce a particular song with ease and perfection. Such an acquirement hones the individual’s abilities with sustaining music notes, desired speed of rendering and ability to switch between speeds effortlessly and rendering the musical expression</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">We understood the role of lungs and vocal cards&nbsp; in voice training. The vocal cords facilitate sound generation and control airflow into the lungs. It was also important to consider their protection of the airway from choking on throat debris and we learnt about pranayama techniques inorder to have maintain good breathing technique which is important for a vocalist and afterwards we tried to understand what it takes to become a top notch vocalist the ins and outs in the end he explained the importance of arts</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">Relation with our course:</span></strong><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The highly structured, centuries-old melodic framework of Carnatic music is rich and varied. The 22 srutis that can be recognised by the human ear were developed by ancient musicologists&nbsp; They also created a number of note patterns that help to expand the human vocal system's flexibility, range, and quality of sound. Finding and fixing the sruti or adhara shadjamam for a certain learner is the first stage in Voice Training</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The system includes everything from simple practise material to the most complex masterpieces from a variety of composers.In a more organised manner Purandara Dasa wrote out the specifics of the educational system.There are essentially two main branches:</span><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">1. Abhyasa&nbsp; ganam (Precomposed music): Practicing verses and musical compositions by&nbsp; vaggeyakaras like Ramadasa, Annamayya etc Abhyasa gana is a precomposed music. It includes the initial simple practice verses to complex&nbsp; varnams and&nbsp; kritis. The initial practice exercises emphasize on singing the basic sapta swaras at right frequency level in reference to the fundamental note</span><br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">2.Manodharma Sangeetham (Improvised Music): During a live performance, improvisation takes place dynamically in the form of Raga alapana (exploring the nuances of the raga), Neraval (lyrical exploration), Swara kalpana (permutations and combinations of swara patterns adhering to the raga along with the tala and emotion of the song), and Pallavi of composition</span><br><br></p>
